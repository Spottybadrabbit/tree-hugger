# tree-hugger
Mining source code repositories at scale easily. Tree-hugger is a light-weight, high level library which provides Pythonic APIs  to mine recursively trough Github repositories.
Tree-hugger is built on top of tree-sitter and covers Python and PHP source code. Coming soon: Java ana d JavaScript.

_System Requirement: Python 3.6_

## Installation

### From pip:

```
pip install tree-hugger
```

### From Source:

```
git clone https://github.com/autosoft-dev/tree-hugger.git

cd tree-hugger

pip install -e .
```

_The installation process is tested in macOS Mojave, we have a [separate docker binding](https://github.com/autosoft-dev/tree-sitter-docker) for compiling the libraries for Linux and soon this library will be integrated in that as well_

_You may need to install libgit2. In case you are in mac just use `brew install libgit2`_

## Setup

### Building the .so files

_Please note that building the libraries has been tested under a macOS Mojave with Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)_

_Please check out our Linux specific instructions [here](https://github.com/autosoft-dev/tree-sitter-docker)_

Once this library is installed it gives you a command line utility to download and compile tree-sitter .so files with ease. As an example - 

```
create_libs python
```

Here is the full usage guide of the command

```
usage: create_libs [-h] [-c] [-l LIB_NAME] langs [langs ...]

positional arguments:
  langs                 Give the name of languages for tree-sitter (php,
                        python, go ...)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --copy-to-workspace
                        Shall we copy the created libs to the present dir?
                        (default: False)
  -l LIB_NAME, --lib-name LIB_NAME
                        The name of the generated .so file
```

### Environment variables
You can set up `TS_LIB_PATH` environment variable for the tree-sitter lib path and then the libary will use them automatically. Otherwise, as an alternative, you can pass it when creating any `Parser` object.


## Hello world example

1. **Generate the librairies** : run the above command to generate the libraries. 

    In our settings we use the `-c` flag to copy the generated `tree-sitter` library's `.so` file to our workspace. Once copied, we place it under a directory called `tslibs` (It is in the .gitignore).
    
    âš  If you are using linux then this command probably won't work and you will need to use our [tree-sitter-docker](https://github.com/autosoft-dev/tree-sitter-docker) image and manually copy the final .so file.

2. **Queries files** : We have supplied one example query file under [**queries**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autosoft-dev/tree-hugger/master/queries/example_queries.yml) directory. 

3. **Setup environment variable** (optional)
Assuming that you have the necessary environment variable setup. The following line of code will create a `PythonParser` object

```python
from tree_hugger.core import PythonParser

pp = PythonParser()
```

And then you can pass in any Python file that you want to analyze, like so :

```python
pp.parse_file("tests/assets/file_with_different_functions.py")
Out[3]: True
```

`parse_file` returns `True` if success

And then you are free to use the methods exposed by that particular Parser object. As an example - 

```python
pp.get_all_function_names()
Out[4]:
['first_child',
 'second_child',
 'say_whee',
 'wrapper',
 'my_decorator',
 'parent']
```

OR

```python
pp.get_all_function_documentations()
Out[5]:
{'parent': '"""This is the parent function\n    \n    There are other lines in the doc string\n    This is the third line\n\n    And this is the fourth\n    """',
 'first_child': "'''\n        This is first child\n        '''",
 'second_child': '"""\n        This is second child\n        """',
 'my_decorator': '"""\n    Outer decorator function\n    """',
 'say_whee': '"""\n    Hellooooooooo\n\n    This is a function with decorators\n    """'}
 ```

 *(Notice that, in the last call, it only returns the functions which has a documentation comment)*

## Extending tree-hugger

Extending tree-hugger for other languages and/or more functionalities for the already provided ones, is easy. 

1. ### Adding languages:
Parsed languages can be extended through adding a parser class from the BaseParser class. The only mandatory argument that a Parser class should pass to the parent is the `language`. This is a string. Such as `python` (remember, lower case). Although, each parser class must have the options to take in the path of the tree-sitter library (.so file that we are using to parse the code) and the path to the queries yaml file, in their constructor.

The BaseParser class can do few things for you.

It loads and prepares the .so file with respect to the language you just mentioned.

It loads, parses, and prepares the query yaml file. (for the queries, we internally use an extended UserDict class. More on that later.)

It gives an API to parse a file and prepare it for query. `BaseParser.parse_file`

It also gives you another (most likely not to be exposed outside) API `_run_query_and_get_captures` which lets you run any queries and return back the matched results (if any) from the parsed tree.

If you are interested to see the example of one of the methods in the PythonParser class, to know how all of these come together. Here it is (Do not forget, we use those APIs once we have called `parse_file` and parsed the file) -

The function `match_from_span` is a very handy function. It is defined in the BaseParser module. It takes a span definition and returns the underlying code string from it.

2. ### Adding queries: 
Queries processed on source code are s-expressions (Remember LISP?) that work on the parsed code and gives you what you want. Tree-hugger gives you a way to write your queries in yaml file for each language parsed (Check out the [queries/example_queries.yml](queries/example_queries.yml)) file to see som examples for Python. 

This main section  is further sub-divided into sections (as many as you need). Each of them has the same structure. A name of a query followed by the query itself. Written as an s-expression. One example:

```
all_function_docstrings:
        "
        (
            function_definition
            name: (identifier) @function.def
            body: (block(expression_statement(string))) @function.docstring
        )
        "
```
You have to follow yaml grammar while writing these queries. You can see a bit more about writng these queries in the [documentation of tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#pattern-matching-with-queries). 

Some example queries, that you will find in the yaml file (and their corresponding API from the PythonParser class) - 

```
* all_function_names => get_all_function_names()

* all_function_docstrings => get_all_function_documentations()

* all_class_methods => get_all_class_method_names()
```


## Roadmap
